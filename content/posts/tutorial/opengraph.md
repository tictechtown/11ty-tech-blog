When sharing a URL, some sites will generate a preview with a title, description and image using certain [OpenGraph](https://ogp.me/) metadata.

### Set the preview image

A default Opengraph preview image for all posts is set in the [metadata.json](./2022-01-01-edit-the-metadata.md#opengraph), which looks like:

```
{% raw %}
<!-- {% figure metadata.opengraph.image, "Default opengraph image", "third" %} -->{% endraw %}
```

To override the preview image for a specific post, set the `opengraph.image` value in the frontmatter:

```
---
title: How to set Opengraph preview image and metadata
opengraph:
  image: /assets/images/image003.jpg
---
```

### Title, description, and tags

All three of these are taken from the post's frontmatter's title, description, and tags.

```

description: Instructions on setting up various Opengraph headers
tags:
  - opengraph
  - image
  - preview
opengraph:
  image: /assets/images/image003.jpg
---
```

If missing, the defaults are taken from the [metadata.json](./2022-01-01-edit-the-metadata.md#optional-but-useful) again.

### Author and type

The author and type are always taken from the metadata.json author and type.
