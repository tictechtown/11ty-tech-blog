When writing posts, it's nice for the reader to be able to see all posts related to the same tag. Also an important step for the writer, to organize his thoughts and ideas.
Thankfully, eleventy makes it easy to automate this process.

### In the frontmatter

The tags can be set in the page's frontmatter.

```markdown
---
title: ...
description: ...
tags: tag1
---
```

By default, if you write `tags: tag1 tag2 tag3`, Eleventy will interpret this as one tag with name `tag1 tag2 tag3`. This is not something we want.
Instead, if you want a list of tags, you should use the following syntax

```markdown
---
title: ...
description: ...
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
  - tag3
---
```

This will create 3 tags, `tag1` `tag2` and `tag3`

### In the enclosing folder

You can automatically add tags to every entries in the same folder if you create a `.json` with the folder name.
For instance, if you are in the folder `tutorial`, add a `tutorial.json` in it, with the following values:

```json
{
  "tags": ["tutorial"]
}
```

This will automatically add the tag `tutorial` to all posts inside the folder `tutorial`.
